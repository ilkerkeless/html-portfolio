<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a fourth-year student in the Digital Game Design department at Beykoz University. I grew
  up surrounded by games and have been actively involved in the gaming industry for the past
  three years. During this time, I worked as a level designer at Oyedu for 7 months during my
  internships. After that, I continued to gain experience in the same role at Stak Games for
  another 6 months.
  Participating in game jams and working on projects at school has taught me the importance of
  teamwork. Additionally, I received training in Level Design with Unreal Engine at Navras
  Academy and completed the Environment Art course at Leartes Studios. I am committed to
  continuous improvement and aim to work in the gaming industry for many years to come.
  As a beginner of web development i really enjoy to learn how to design and code. My biggest passion
  is learning new skills and learning web development is my new challenge. </p>
